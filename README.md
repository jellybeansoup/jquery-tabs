#jQuery Tabs

Tabs is a jQuery plugin that groups specially marked elements together as a tab group.

##Requirements

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

##Installation

Copy the Tabs file (either the uncompressed or the minified one) to your resources directory and then simply link to the file in your HTML document.

```html
<script src="jquery-tabs.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

To get up and running quickly, you can set Tabs to automatically match all elements within the document with the "data-tab-group" attribute set by adding "?auto" to the end of the `script` element's `src` attribute.

```html
<script src="jquery-tabs.js?auto" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

##Using Tabs

To run Tabs, simply run the function, providing the name of an attribute as a parameter:

```javascript
$.tabs( 'data-tab-group' );
```

Elements with the same value will be grouped together as part of a tab group. See the `example.html` file for an example of how it works.
